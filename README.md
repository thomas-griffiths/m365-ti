# M365 Threat Feed Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate an **open-source threat feed** with **Microsoft 365 (Outlook Email)** using the Microsoft Graph API.  
The goal is to fetch indicators from a public threat feed and use them to check and act upon emails inside an M365 environment.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Connects to Microsoft 365 using OAuth2 and Microsoft Graph API.  
- Retrieves indicators (IPs, domains, URLs, hashes) from a threat feed.  
- Cross-checks indicators against Outlook email metadata (senders, URLs, attachments).  
- Supports enrichment workflows for SOC or demo purposes.  
- Provides a baseline for POCs (Proof of Concepts) in threat intelligence and API integrations.  

---

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites
- Microsoft 365 tenant with **Outlook Email (Defender for Office 365)**.  
- An **Azure App Registration** with the following API permissions:  
  - `Mail.Read`  
  - `Mail.ReadWrite`  
  - `Mail.ReadBasic`  
- `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `tenant_id` for authentication.  
- Python 3.9+  
- `pip` for dependency management
